It is indicated where there is feebleness of the vascular apparatus, and a tendency to congestion with nervous prostration; and phlegmatic temperaments admit it more readily than the nervous or sanguine. In atonic conditions of the stomach and bowels, giving rise to particular forms of indigestion, flatulence, colic pains, and coldness, it is of use combined with tonics. In excessive mucous discharges, with debility of the membranes and the general system, it exhibits its virtues to great advantage; as in chronic leucorrhea and catarrh, when the secretions have become offensive; likewise in low ulcerations of the bowels and the bladder, providing no inflammatory excitement be present. It may be used directly to the vagina, in bad leucorrhea; and when combined with bayberry or a little capsicum, forms a potent injection to the bowels in passive hemorrhages following typhus. As a local application in degenerate ulcers, it is of great valueâ€“especially in phagedaena, malignant and foetid sores, carbuncles, malignant scarlatina, putrid sore throat and diphtheria, and after an indolent bubo has been opened. In these cases it is best to combine it with capsicum or other stimulant, but seldom with astringents. I have found it of good service in phagedaenic chancres, along with lobelia seeds and a little capsicum. In all such local cases it may be used in powder, tincture, or watery solution. It is a favorite appliance in aphthous sores, and bleeding or spongy gums. Many make use of its tincture in liniments; but being so largely resinous, it soon forms a layer of varnish upon the surfaceâ€“thereby shutting in the perspiration that should escape at the part, and preventing the subsequent applications from reaching the structures.","","-","http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/cook/BALSAMODENDRON_MYRRHA.htm"
